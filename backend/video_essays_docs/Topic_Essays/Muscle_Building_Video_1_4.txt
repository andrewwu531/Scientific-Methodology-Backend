Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are important for muscle hypertrophy as it provides the energy needed to fuel high intensity exercise and support the recovery process. When you engage in resistance training, you deplete glycogen storage in your muscles. With insufficient glycogen/ carbohydrate, your body will not look for muscle tissue for energy.
Consuming sufficient carbohydrates in combination with high protein intake can enhance muscle protein synthesis, which is the process by which the body builds new muscle tissue. 
Fat
Dietary fat is essential for hormonal production, including testosterone, important for building and maintaining muscle tissues. Furthermore, it supports the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, including vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Saturated Fat - bad
Saturated fats are typically found in animal-based foods such as meat, butter, cheese, and cream, as well as some plant-based products such as coconut oil and palm oil. They are known to increase LDL (low density lipoprotein) or the "bad" cholesterol levels in blood. Therefore, it is recommended to limit the intake of saturated fats to less than 10% of total daily calories.
Unsaturated Fat - good
On the other hand, unsaturated fats are found from food such as fish, nuts, seeds, avocado and olive oil. Unsaturated fats are divided into two types: monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats are known to improve cholesterol levels by increasing HDL (high density lipoprotein) or "good" cholesterol levels, and decreasing LDL cholesterol levels.
