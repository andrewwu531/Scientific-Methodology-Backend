Step 3 - Incorporating the carb cycling approach
The goal of carb cycling is to help reduce a personâ€™s caloric intake, achieving caloric deficit for fat loss, as carbohydrates contain calories. 
In practice, you can cut carbohydrates completely for one meal for a non-workout day and do not cut carbohydrates at all for a workout day. This is an ideal strategy as you require more energy from carbohydrates for your workout and recovery, while promoting fat burning for your non-workout day.
Furthermore, carb cycling is considered the secret of achieving a youthful facial tone as you will not build facial fat through caloric surplus other than mostly through protein.
