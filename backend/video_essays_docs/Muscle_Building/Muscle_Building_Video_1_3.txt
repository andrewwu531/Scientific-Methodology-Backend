Maintenance diet
A maintenance diet involves consuming the recommended macronutrients and does not lead to significant change in body composition. 
Calorie surplus diet
In a calorie surplus diet, a person consumes more calories than the body expends. This type of diet can lead to muscle and fat gain.
Belows are the features of following a caloric surplus diet:
Promotes muscle growth and prevents muscle breakdown - Consuming a caloric surplus diet provides the body with the additional nutrients needed to support muscle growth and prevent muscle breakdown.
Improved strength and performance - Consuming a caloric surplus diet can help to improve strength and performance during intense workout as you consume more nutrients. This leads to greater muscle growth.
Increased energy levels - Consuming a caloric surplus diet improves your overall energy levels and improves focus for daily tasks.
Supports recovery - Following a caloric surplus diet supports greater muscle recovery and reduces the risk of injury as your body stores more macronutrients.
Boosts metabolism - A caloric surplus diet boosts metabolism, which leads to increased calorie burn and weight loss in the long term.
Protein
Consuming a high protein diet combined with weight training led to greater gains in muscle mass size and strength. When you engage in weightlifting sessions, you create small tears in your muscle fibres. Therefore, you will have sufficient or excess macronutrients to rebuild and grow your muscles. Protein plays an important role for muscle hypertrophy as it provides the building blocks to build and repair muscle tissue.
