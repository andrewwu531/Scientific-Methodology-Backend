Creatine 
Creatine is an oral bodybuilding supplement that stimulates muscle growth and repair by restoring the water weight of muscle tissues. It acts as a sustainable, yet viable solution to increase muscle mass because creatine comes in the form of tablets which is easy to consume. 
Creatine is considered the most effective supplement to increase lean muscle mass and strength, as well as to help you recover quickly during and after workout.
However, your face could look quite bulky as a result of consuming creatine due to the water weight stored by the creatine. 
Eating a normal diet with just natural food can also achieve the same outcome.
However, it also depends on your bodybuilding goal. If you want to be very big, consuming the right amount of protein drinks and creatine is necessary.
