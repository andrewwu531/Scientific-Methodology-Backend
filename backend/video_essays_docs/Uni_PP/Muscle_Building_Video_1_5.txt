Now, we divide my daily macronutrient intakes by three as I eat 3 equal portion meals a day.

Easier to satisfy the macronutrient requirements - you would not need to consume food excessively for one of the three meals. In other words, if you eat less in the evening, you would require eating more in the morning or afternoon to compensate for the lesser food consumption in the evening.
Heavy breakfast burns more calories than heavy lunch or dinner - in science, it is ideal to eat a large meal in the morning. Given equal quantity, the breakfast meal burns twice the calories compared to lunch or dinner. This is beneficial for achieving caloric deficit to reduce fat for revealing a six pack.
It boosts energy and reduces hunger - you require high energy for breakfast and lunch as you work during the day time. Moreover, you require sufficient food consumption in the evening to prevent muscle loss while sleeping.
