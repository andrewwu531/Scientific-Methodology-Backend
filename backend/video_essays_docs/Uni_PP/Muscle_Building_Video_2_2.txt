Weightlifting Techniques 
Choose the right weights - distinguish between powerlifting and bodybuilding workout
If your weightlifting goal is to build muscle, you should focus on using bodybuilding methods rather than powerlifting methods. 
The key distinction between powerlifting and bodybuilding lifting is that powerlifting primarily enhances power (less on muscle size), whereas bodybuilding focuses on body mass and shape. 
Practically, powerlifters lift very heavy weights all the time, whereas bodybuilding focuses on varying reps with different exercises and weights for the same target muscle groups. 
To understand this bodybuilding concept, firstly you must understand that muscles grow through breakage and repairment while resting. To optimally break your muscle fibres, your muscles must suffer from micro-trauma all the time. However, when you are doing the same exercises and weights, your body will gradually adapt to the exercises and weights. This suggests that the muscle fibres will rebuild and grow slowly as there is less damage. 
Therefore, you must vary your exercises, weight, and reps to stimulate muscle growth. In short, do exercises that are new, uncomfortable, and challenging to you all the time.
