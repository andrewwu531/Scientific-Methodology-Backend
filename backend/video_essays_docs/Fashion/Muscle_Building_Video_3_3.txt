Protein Drinks 
While drinking protein drinks is one possible method to achieve higher protein consumption, it can be considered not an ideal solution because it tastes poor. If you cannot consume protein drinks for life, then it is not a sustainable solution. 
Furthermore, protein drinks are consumed in the form of powder which makes it too easy to digest. Particularly, if you are following the caloric deficit diet, hunger is the most striking issue to tackle.
Instead of consuming protein drinks for your diet, you may consider increasing your portion size and your protein percentage in each meal. This will result in the same bodybuilding outcome and you are building a habit of consuming the correct amount of natural food. 
Another drawback of consuming protein drinks is if you consume it without careful calculation, it can result in excessive weight gain. This is because it is difficult to perceive the amount of protein and calories you are taking within each drink, unless you use the macro calculator effectively. Some products I found in 2016 have high levels of calories.
