The Theoretical Mechanism of Muscle Building
Muscles grow through a process called muscle hypertrophy. There are two main types of muscle hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic hypertrophy and myofibrillar hypertrophy.
Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy 
Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is the increase in the volume of the sarcoplasm, which is the fluid within muscle cells that contains energy substrates and proteins.
Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy can be achieved through specific training techniques.
High Volume Training - Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is often achieved through high volume training, which involves performing a high number of repetitions (8-15 reps) with a moderate weight.
Short Rest Periods - Short rest periods between sets can also help to promote sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. By limiting the amount of rest time between sets, you create metabolic stress within the muscle, which lead to an increase in the volume of the sarcoplasm. The optimal rest period is 30 seconds to 2 minutes. 
Focus on Isolation Exercises - Isolation exercises, which focus on a single muscle group, can be particularly effective for promoting sarcoplasmic hypertrophy.
Incorporate Drop Sets - Drop sets involve performing a set of an exercise until failure, after which you immediately reduce the weight and continue to perform the same exercise with additional repetitions until failure. This technique helps to promote sarcoplasmic hypertrophy by increasing the duration of metabolic stress within the target muscle groups.
Myofibrillar Hypertrophy 
Myofibrillar hypertrophy is the increase in the size and number of myofibrils, which are the contractile units within muscle cells. 
Myofibrillar hypertrophy can be achieved through specific training techniques:
High Resistance Training - Myofibrillar hypertrophy is achieved through high resistance training, which involves using a heavy weight or resistance for a low number of repetitions (1-5 & 6-8 reps).
Focus on Compound Exercises - Compound exercises, which involve training multiple muscle groups, can be particularly effective for promoting myofibrillar hypertrophy. Exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench press, and overhead press can help to increase the overall strength and size of the respective muscle groups.
Progressive Overload - Continually increasing the weight or resistance used in your training program helps to stimulate muscle growth over time.
Adequate Rest and Recovery - Adequate rest and recovery are important for promoting myofibrillar hypertrophy. The optimal rest period is 2-5 minutes.
