The key to sustaining a low fat diet is the appliance you use - the magic of the airfryer
An airfryer is a cooking appliance similar to an oven. It is a magical appliance ever invented as you do not require adding oil to the food you are cooking. You can cook chicken thigh without using oil with an airfryer.
Whether adding oil to your meal seems not a big deal to bodybuilding. However, a 1 litre of vegetable oil contains 8990 kcal of calories and 1000g of fat. 
Assuming you add 1/20 of a litre of vegetable oil a day, which is 50g. You would consume an additional 179.8g of calories and 20g of fat, a crucial factor that determines if you will enter the caloric deficit and achieve the threshold of the low fat diet.
